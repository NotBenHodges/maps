    <h1>Mistakes when using maps</h1>
    <p>1. When creating proportional symbol maps manually, it is tempting to <br>
    scale symbols such as circles by the diameter. However, this method <br>
    creates an area larger than the area the data represents. The area should <br>
    be scaled, not the diameter.</p>
    <p>2. It is important to place symbols in the place where their values were <br>
    observed. When creating a visualization of various regions, symbols should <br>
    be placed in the center of thier respective regions or else the reader <br>
    might become confused.</p>
